I am pursuing an Academic Master's degree at the Mbot Embodied Intelligence Laboratory of Donghua University, under the supervision of Professor [**Mingbo Zhao**](https://mingbozhao.github.io/). Prior to this, I graduated from the Department of Automation of Donghua University with an Academic Bachelor's degree. My research focuses on 3D garment generation.

From March 2025 to November 2025, I worked in the team led by Professor [**Huaming Wang**](https://wanghmin.github.io/) at [**Style3D**](https://www.style3d.com/), where I was engaged in research related to patch-based 3D garment AIGC algorithms. During this period, I participated in the [**GarmageNet**](https://style3d.github.io/garmagenet/) project and constructed **GarmageSet**, a large-scale dataset containing over 10,000 professionally designed garments with detailed structural and stylistic annotations. Additionally, I independently completed the R&D of two patents for the automatic arrangement of stitched garment panels onto human body models.
