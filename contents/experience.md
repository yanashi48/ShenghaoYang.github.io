*Research Assistant* | Mar. 2025 – Nov. 2025  
Supervised by Prof. [Huamin Wang](https://wanghmin.github.io/)  

- Engaged in research on **patch-based 3D garment AIGC algorithms**, focusing on the integration of sewing pattern design and 3D garment generation, which laid the technical foundation for the GarmageNet project.
- Participated in the **GarmageNet** project, a core multimodal generative framework for sewing pattern design and generic garment modeling. The related paper is published in **ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)**, SIGGRAPH Asia 2025:

- Constructed **GarmaGeSet**, a large-scale dataset containing over 10,000 professionally designed garments with detailed structural (sewing pattern) and stylistic annotations. This dataset provides critical data support for the training and evaluation of the GarmageNet multimodal generation model.
- Independently completed R&D of **two patents** for the automatic arrangement of stitched garment panels onto human body models, solving key technical bottlenecks in 3D garment fitting and improving the efficiency of garment digitalization.
